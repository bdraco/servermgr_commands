# servermgr_commands

This is an automatically created list of commands, parsed from the servermgr_bundles using the strings command.

Many of the commands require additional parameters that has to be entered either using the interactive prompt or a command file.

This is a starting point as I'm trying to get more control of the OS X Server services from the command line.
